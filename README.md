# Test tusk: atlasNewsApp

I also want to note that in the test task there were no criteria for the use of specific principles and architectures. When performing work tasks, I am always ready to discuss the criteria for writing code. With that one task, for the most part, I wanted to write the most understandable and concise code in a reasonable time by doing only what is described in the task. I did not go deep and did not complicate the task. I look forward to your response and further interaction.

## How the app looks like:
